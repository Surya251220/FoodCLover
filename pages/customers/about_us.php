			<h2>Our Restaurant's History</h2>
			<p>Food Clover is a newly established Indian restaurant located in the heart of the city. We opened our doors to the public just 6 months ago, but we have already become a local favorite. Our founder, John Doe, has always been passionate about Indian cuisine and he wanted to share his love for the food with others. He spent years perfecting his recipes and learning about the culture and traditions of Indian cooking before finally opening Food Clover.</p>

			<h2>Our Food</h2>
			<p>Food Clover's history is closely linked to our menu, which features some of the most beloved and traditional dishes of Indian cuisine. </p>
			<h3>Samosas</h3>
			<p>Our samosas are a classic Indian snack, consisting of crispy fried pastry filled with spiced potatoes and peas. They are a staple at Indian restaurants around the world, and they have quickly become one of our customers' favorites.</p>
			<h3>Paneer Tikka</h3>
			<p>Another popular starter on our menu is the paneer tikka, which consists of grilled cubes of marinated Indian cottage cheese. It is a vegetarian alternative to the popular chicken tikka, and it is a great option for those who are looking for a protein-rich dish with a mild, smoky flavor.</p>
			<h3>Lamb Rogan Josh</h3>
			<p>For those who prefer something a bit spicier, we recommend the lamb rogan josh, which is one of the most iconic dishes of Kashmiri cuisine. It features tender lamb cooked in a spicy tomato-based sauce, with a perfect balance of aromatic spices such as cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.</p>
			<h3>Saag Paneer</h3>
			<p>One of our most popular vegetarian dishes is the saag paneer, which consists of spinach cooked with Indian cottage cheese in a creamy sauce. It is a healthy and flavorful option that is perfect for those who are looking for a vegetarian alternative to the classic chicken tikka masala.</p>
			<h3>Drinks</h3>
			<p>Finally, to round out your meal, we recommend trying our refreshing sweet lassi, which is a sweet yogurt-based drink that is perfect for cooling down after a spicy meal. If you prefer something with a bit more kick, our Indian summer cocktail is a refreshing mix of gin, lemon juice, and soda water, with a hint of spice from our secret blend of Indian spices.</p>
